# DayZ SA Mod: Bash Client
Bash Client is an open-source developer enviroment mod for DayZ Standalone. Designed for in-game debugging without being forced to use the diagnostic client and DayZ Tool's Workbench. Bash Client is built on top of [Community Framework](https://github.com/Jacob-Mango/DayZ-Community-Framework) for modularity.
